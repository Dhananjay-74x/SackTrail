## Project by Shashank Mishra, Dhananjay Gaur
 
A RFID-based airport security system is demonstrated by the system. We employ an RFID module, Node MCU ESP8266, and a fronted based on PHP , HTML ,CSS JavaScript all compiled on APACHE2 Server to regulate how the device functions for this purpose.
MFRC522 is quad tripled in modules to make 4 different gateways, each gateway comprising of the NODEMCU and the RFID reader , to detect incoming luggageâ€™s attached with RFID tags as in below images.
